# About

Ecosystem ecology takes a holistic approach in studying the environment. It involves integrated investigation of living and nonliving components of ecosystems, how those components interact, and how those interactions affect ecosystem structure and function. 

The SMCM Coastal Ecosystem Ecology Lab investigates how human stressors, like climate change and nutrient pollution, affect coastal foundation species, such as seagrass (also known as submersed aquatic vegetation, or SAV) and salt marshes. We also investigate how changes in marsh and SAV abundance, in turn, affect coastal ecosystem processes. Our goal is to understand the underlying mechanisms of coastal ecosystem decline, recovery, and resilience, and to quantify the effects of ecological change on ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling. 

This is important work because many of the functions that SAV and marshes carry out are valuable to people. For example, in the Chesapeake Bay region, federal, state, and local jurisdictions are spending a lot of time and money to reduce nutrient inputs to the estuary through one of the most ambitious coastal restoration programs in the world. Research that aims to understand how human activities affect marshes and SAV, and how these systems, in turn, affect estuarine nutrient cycling, informs these restoration efforts.
