I am always looking for undergraduate students to participate in my research. There are a number of ways to get involved – I’m happy to chat at any point in your college career to talk about research opportunities in my lab and beyond. Stop by my office hours or email me to set up an appointment.

### St. Mary’s Project  
If the Coastal Ecosystem Ecology Lab’s general research themes interest you, I would love to work with you to develop a [St. Mary’s Project (SMP)](http://www.smcm.edu/academics/st-marys-projects/) that both aligns with your interests and advances the lab’s research. If you are a first or second year student, you can start learning the ropes by helping out with lab and field work informally or registering for independent study or directed research credits (see below). If you are a junior working on your SMP prospectus, I am happy to co-develop a research plan with you. Either way, let’s talk! 


### Independent study or directed research  
You can conduct research in my lab and earn course credit for it at any stage in your undergraduate career! Come talk to me if this is something that interests you.

### St. Mary’s Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program     
St. Mary’s College of Maryland (SMCM) awards competitive fellowships for students to conduct research during the summer through the [SURF](https://sites.google.com/smcm.edu/surf-smcm/home) program. A research proposal is an integral component of the application package. I would love to help you develop a proposal that aligns with the Coastal Ecosystem Ecology Lab’s research. If you’re interested in applying to the SURF program, we should start talking about your proposal during the Fall semester or winter break so that you have plenty of time to revise and submit it by the March deadline.
