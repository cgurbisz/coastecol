What a rainy, wet summer this was! The Conowingo Dam frequently opened its flood gates. In August, Susquehanna River flow rates exceeded 300,000 cfs for the first time since 2011. We tried to sample for bottom sediment and SAV in the upper Bay in mid-August, but the water was so turbid at most of our sample sites that I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face. 

Check out this coverage of the flooding and our work in the upper Bay in the [Baltimore Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/environment/bs-md-chesapeake-flooding-impact-20180815-story.html) and the [Chesapeake Bay Journal](https://www.bayjournal.com/article/washed_away_torrential_rains_threaten_bay_restoration_gains). 

One interesting observation: although the upper Bay SAV beds adjacent to the main channel were super turbid, water in the center of the main Susquehanna Flats bed was crystal clear. You can even see this phenomenon in the daily satellite images. This is consistent with what I found while working on my dissertation: the SAV bed clears up the overlying water and shunts flow around itself. This is a mechanism by which the SAV bed resists the stress of poor water clarity and high flows during flood events.

We did finally collect our samples in September – later than expected, but just in time because Conowingo floodgates opened again just a week later. We’re interested in measuring the extent to which SAV are trapping sediment and particulate nutrients, so these samples directly following several flood events will be revealing.
