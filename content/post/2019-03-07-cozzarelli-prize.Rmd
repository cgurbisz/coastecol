The National Academy of Sciences awarded a paper on which I recently collaborated the Cozzarelli Prize. The paper, titled, "Long-term nutrient reductions lead to the unprecedented recovery of a temperate coastal region," was the product of a data synthesis working group funded by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program. We showed that reductions in nitrogen pollution led to widespread recovery of submersed aquatic vegetation in the Chesapeake Bay. What an honor to work with such a diverse and talented group of scientists!
