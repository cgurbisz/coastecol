After postponing fieldwork several times due to bad weather, we finally made it out to Susquehanna Flats in the upper Chesapeake Bay to collect sediment and plant samples. 

This work is part of our [SAV beds as nutrient and sediment sinks](https://gurbisz-coastecol.netlify.com/project/2018-05-22-sav-beds-as-nutrient-and-sediment-sinks/) project, a collaboration with [Cindy Palinkas](http://www.umces.edu/cindy-palinkas) from University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Horn Point Laboratory. Through this research, we will quantify and predict the extent to which upper Bay SAV beds trap and process nutrient and sediment inputs from the Susquehanna River. Trapping nutrients and sediment is beneficial for SAV because the water becomes more clear, and the plants have more sunlight to grow. However, these processes may also be beneficial for the whole estuary if the plants trap enough nitrogen and phosphorus to limit their harmful effect on the system. Ultimately, we aim to develop a better understanding of whether and to what extent SAV recovery can help tip estuarine ecosystems into a more healthy state.
