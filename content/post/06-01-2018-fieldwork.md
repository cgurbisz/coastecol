After postponing fieldwork several times due to bad weather, we finally made it out to Susquehanna Flats in the upper Chesapeake Bay to collect sediment and plant samples. Back at the lab, we'll use a stable isotope called Beryllium-7 to quantify sediment deposition rates within and adjacent to SAV beds. Then we'll analyze the sediment for nitrogen and phosphorus content so that we can derive particulate nutrient deposition rates. We'll also dry and weigh our plant samples to quantify plant biomass within each SAV bed. 

Ultimately, the goal is to measure the effect of SAV beds on nutrient retention in the upper bay. We'll go back out later in the summer and do everything all over again once SAV biomass has peaked. This will allow us to compare what happens to nutrients when SAV are sparse and short in the spring vs. dense and tall in the summer.

This work is part of our [SAV beds as nutrient and sediment sinks](https://gurbisz-coastecol.netlify.com/project/2018-05-22-sav-beds-as-nutrient-and-sediment-sinks/) project, a collaboration with [Cindy Palinkas](http://www.umces.edu/cindy-palinkas) from University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Horn Point Laboratory. Through this research, we will quantify and predict the extent to which upper Bay SAV beds trap nutrient and sediment inputs from the Susquehanna River. Retaining nutrients and sediment is beneficial for SAV because the water becomes more clear, so the plants have more sunlight to grow. However, these processes may also be beneficial for the whole estuary if the plants trap enough nitrogen and phosphorus to limit their harmful effect on the broader ecosystem. Ultimately, we aim to develop a better understanding of whether and to what extent SAV recovery can help tip estuarine ecosystems into a more healthy state.
